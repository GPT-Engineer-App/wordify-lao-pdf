Create a web app for converting PDF to Word

**Web App Structure**

1. **Frontend**
	* User Interface (UI) designed in Lao language
	* Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices (desktop, mobile)
	* File upload functionality with drag-and-drop and browse options
	* Progress bar or visual indicator to show the conversion process
2. **Backend**
	* Server-side programming using a language like Node.js, Python, or Ruby
	* Integration with OCR libraries specifically supporting the Lao language
	* Conversion of PDFs to editable Word documents (.docx format)
	* Basic editing functionalities (optional)
3. **Database**
	* Storage for uploaded files and user data
	* Security measures to protect uploaded files and user data

**OCR Library Integration**

1. Choose an OCR library that supports the Lao language, such as:
	* Tesseract-OCR (open-source, widely used)
	* ABBYY FineReader (commercial, popular)
	* Google Cloud Vision API (cloud-based, scalable)
2. Integrate the chosen OCR library with the backend using APIs or SDKs

**Conversion Process**

1. Upload Lao PDF file to the web app
2. Define the OCR language as Lao during upload
3. Run the OCR library to extract text from the PDF file
4. Convert the extracted text into a fully editable Word document (.docx format)
5. Preserve the original layout of the PDF document as much as possible
6. Allow for basic editing functionalities within the web app (optional)

**Download & View**

1. Provide a download button to save the converted Word document to the user's device
2. Ensure the downloaded file is compatible with Microsoft Word for seamless editing

**Security Measures**

1. Implement encryption to protect uploaded files and user data
2. Use secure protocols for data transmission and storage
3. Implement access controls and authentication to prevent unauthorized access

**Accessibility Features**

1. Provide alternative text for images and graphics
2. Implement screen reader compatibility for users with visual impairments
3. Ensure keyboard navigation and accessible form controls

**Cloud Storage Integration**

1. Integrate with popular cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
2. Allow users to upload and download files directly from their cloud storage

**Success Criteria**

1. High accuracy in Lao character recognition using OCR libraries
2. Preserved document layout during conversion
3. User-friendly interface and efficient conversion process
4. Compatibility with Microsoft Word for editing the converted document

By following this outline, you'll be well on your way to creating a reliable and user-friendly web application that converts Lao PDFs into editable Word documents using OCR libraries.
